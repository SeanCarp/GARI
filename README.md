# GARI
GARI (General Artificial Responsive Intelligence) is a personal assistant that is built in python. While GARI, is not a living, breathing being, it is best to imagine it as a groundhog. Holding on to the widsom and knowledge that will start to gain over the years and, only coming out to preform tasks to keep the host in check.

The goals of GARI is to:
- Create a NLP model that to do basic commands through Text, Microphone on Cell Phone, or Microphone on Laptop.
- Have the ability to remember things and save dates as reminders.
- Similar to the goal above but making sure it can not only respond to request but making request call to the host.
